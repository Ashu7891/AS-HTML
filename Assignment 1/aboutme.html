    <h2><u>Shrimad Bhagwat Geeta</u></h2>
    <p>The author of <i><b>the Bhagavad Gita</b></i> is <i><b>Maharishi Veda Vyasa.</b></i> The Bhagavad Gita was spoken by Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to His friend Arjuna on the battlefield of Kuruksettra around five thousand years ago. The Bhagavad Gita, often referred to as the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture, which is part of the epic <i><b>Mahabharata</b></i>. It forms the chapters 23â€“40 of book 6 of the Mahabharata called the <i><b>Bhishma Parva</b></i>. The work is dated to the second half of the first millennium BCE. Typical of the Hindu synthesis, it is considered one of the holy scriptures of Hinduism.

        The Bhagavad Gita is set in a narrative framework of dialogue between the Pandava prince Arjuna and his charioteer guide Krishna, <i><b>an avatar of lord Vishnu</b></i>. At the start of the <i><b>Kurukshetra War</b></i> between <i><b>the Pandavas and the Kauravas</b></i>, Arjuna despairs thinking about the <i><b>violence and death</b></i> the war will cause in the battle against his kin and becomes emotionally preoccupied with a dilemma.   </p>
